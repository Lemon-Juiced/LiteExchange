# Lite Exchange

## Overview
To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is Alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange.

Lite Exchange allows you to harness the power of alchemy to transmute items into other items of equal value. This mod introduces three simple items:

1. **Balance Shard**: A crafting ingredient with a 4% chance to drop from all hostile mobs.
2. **Inert Stone**: A crafting ingredient that can be crafted.
3. **Balance Stone**: A reusable item crafted with other item(s) to transmute them into another item(s) of "equivalent" value.
